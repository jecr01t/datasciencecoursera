# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

Following, the process of transforming the raw data (Samsung data)
that can be obtained [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

The origin of the raw data and a full description can be obtained
[here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

The program assumes the Samsung data exists in a subdirectory called 'data'.
The code could have written more defensively in the sense of informing the
user about a possible unsatisfied condition regarding the location of the 
data files. Due to time constrains that was not possible.

The steps taken by the script can be divided in two groups:

1. Reading data
2. Transforming data

## Reading data
1. Feature labels
2. Subject numbers from 'Test' and 'Training' data sets
3. Activities from both sets (Test and Training)
4. Readings (observations) generated by each subject doing a specific activity
5. Readings are combined with activities and subjects

## Transforming data
1. Merges training and test data sets
2. Extracts variable names having subtrings 'mean' or 'dev' and based on this,
filters out the corresponding columns in the data frame
3. Using the function 'ddply' from the library 'plyr', the data set is processed
to calculate the average readings per each subject-activity combination
4. Activity Id's are substituted by Activity Name
5. Original variable names are processed using regular expressions in order
for them to have meaningful names
